This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm on the Iris dataset using Python and libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib. 
It includes steps for loading and preprocessing the dataset, encoding the target labels, normalizing the features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. 
The model is trained with multiple values of k to determine the best-performing configuration based on accuracy. 
It evaluates the final model using a confusion matrix and visualizes decision boundaries using a 2D projection of the features. 
This project demonstrates a complete, beginner-friendly workflow for applying KNN to a real-world dataset, with outputs including accuracy scores, a confusion matrix, and a decision boundary plot.
